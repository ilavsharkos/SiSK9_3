            <p>One of the novelties of this year’s Symposium is the round tables. Round tables are a format for discussion or lectures on a specific topic involving multiple participants. The goal is to encourage dialogue and the exchange of ideas among speakers on a defined area of science or life. The atmosphere is less formal than at traditional lectures, aiming to encourage participants to express themselves more freely, while also inviting the audience to actively engage in the conversation. We look forward to hearing your contributions at these round tables!</p>

            <p>The first round table, "Science vs. Industry," will take place on <span style="color:#168D38;">Friday, October 11<sup>th</sup>.</span> 
                Our esteemed speakers, Ernest Meštrović, Ivica Komočar, Kristina Marić, Marijana Đaković, Marina Martinić Kavur, and Stribor Marković, will discuss key issues concerning the relationship between scientific research and industrial practice.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Some of the topics you can expect to hear about at this round table include employment in industry versus educational institutions, employer expectations and potential employee challenges, as well as personal experiences of our speakers regarding the clash and connection between industry and science.</p>

                  <p><span class="qna-bold">A: </span>It has for sure made 
                    me more independent since I had to live 
                    alone for the first time in my life, but especially more open 
                    to different viewpoints and cultures since the city I live in 
                    is much more multicultural than Zagreb/Croatia. For the academic growth, 
                    I would say it helped me focus on the important aspects of education in 
                    general, but my studies as a whole because of the different approach 
                    to education in Denmark. </p>

                      <p><span class="qna-bold">A: </span>Honestly, the biggest challenge 
                        was dealing with all the requested paperwork regarding the Erasmus+ 
                        scholarship, and getting fast and sufficient answers from my home and 
                        host institutions. I overcame it by doing the research, asking a 
                        lot of questions and being determined in my goal to study abroad.</p>

                          <p><span class="qna-bold" >A: </span>It's really hard to choose one, 
                            but I think it would be the last dinner and night out I had with all 
                            of my flatmates. Even though it was really sad because our first flatmate 
                            was leaving the next day, my heart was so filled with love for those 
                            people that I felt so happy and grateful to have met them and have the 
                            privilege to share my whole Erasmus experience and my home with them. </p>

                      <p><span class="qna-bold">A: </span>I would advise everyone to study abroad, 
                        as I believe it’s an excellent opportunity to not only explore a new 
                        environment but also to get to know themselves better. It allows you 
                        to embrace everything that’s offered to you, so you can later implement 
                        those experiences and knowledge in your own country.</p>

                            is a sampling trip we had in Northern Spain. During the trip, my friend 
                            and I accidentally bumped our assistant, and he fell off the boat into 
                            a reservoir. In the end, we all ended up swimming together, and it 
                            turned into a hilarious and unforgettable experience!</p>

                        was balancing my social life with academics. Studying in a new country 
                        is an amazing experience, but adapting to a different academic system 
                        can be tricky. With so many events for Erasmus students, finding that 
                        balance became really important. </p>

                        taught me to solve problems independently, gave me the chance to study 
                        in English and improve it, opened up professional opportunities, and 
                        introduced me to amazing people who taught me so much and became my friends.
